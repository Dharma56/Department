   This project “Department Management System” provides us a simple interface for maintenance of student information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges
   to maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and 
   collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.

1. Objectives of the project
    The objective of Student information System is to allow the administrator of any organization to edit and find out the personal details of a student and allows the 
    student to keep up to date his profile. It’ll also facilitate keeping all the records of students, such as their id, name, mailing address, phone number, DOB etc. So,
    all the information about an student will be available in a few seconds.

   • Admin can add/update/delete new staff and student.
   
   • Admin can also change the details of staff and students.
